## Installation

For just using the application, there is no installation required. The application url is http://youtube-clone-85cc9.web.app/.
For the local setup of this application, there are a few npm modules that are required (react, react-scripts, react-dom, etc.). Once the repository is cloned, typing 'npm install' at the command prompt will install all of the required modules.

## Usage

** NOTE: ** This is a working progress and not all of the functionality is working. This is just to demonstrate some of the functionality.
For just using the application, the url is .app.
If installing locally, see the installation steps above to install and then run the application to open a browser window/tab.

The sign-in provider is Google. The sign-in will prompt for a Google account if not signed in. To sign-out, click the avatar in the bottom left.

Click on the '+' to add a text channel.
Once in the channel, messages can be added. The messages are stored as collections in the Cloud Firestore.
